See the LICENSE file for the license that applies to this software package. To give you a hint, the  license starts with a B, and ends with SD.

The classes or files in this package/repository is what I (Freeaqingme) made over the years. It contains a lot of nasty code, workarounds and other quirks to easily extend or speed up things. Feel free to coontribute patches, if they don't break things I'll be happy to apply them. But, complaining that some of the code is nasty stuff is redundant - I know :D

If you use any of these files or have a question about them it would be appreciated if you could let me know.
